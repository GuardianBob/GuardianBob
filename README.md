## 🕹️ Full Stack Developer | Process Improvement Specialist | Project Management Professional | Information Systems and Data Analyst
### Certified Project Management Professional - *Project Management Institute, 2014*
### Certified SCRUM Master - *Scrum Alliance, 2015*

I finally decided to take the leap into software development! I earned a Master’s in Management Information Systems and enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp with a focus on Python Full Stack development. I’ve had enough experience with front-end and back-end development that I can honestly say I enjoy both but really love back-end development because of my drive for process improvement. My strongest coding languages are Python, Django, SQL, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. I’m also experienced with AJAX, APIs, VB.net and G-Code (CNC programming... yes, I have a wood carving robot 🤖).
