# âš¡ Jesse Meyer - Full Stack Developer | Process Improvement Specialist | Project Management Professional | Information Systems and Data Analyst

I finally decided to take the leap into software development! I earned a Masterâ€™s in Management Information Systems and enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp with a focus on Python Full Stack development. Iâ€™ve had enough experience with front-end and back-end development that I can honestly say I enjoy both but really love back-end development because of my drive for process improvement. My strongest coding languages are Python, Django, SQL, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. Iâ€™m also experienced with AJAX, APIs, VB.net and G-Code (CNC programming... yes, I have a wood carving robot).
